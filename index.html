<p>This is the project page of the combined courses Code of Nature &amp; Nature of Code at KISD, Köln International School of Design 2013. It's an experiment to approach Design- &amp; Media-theory from discussion and discourse, by reading and writing essays and articles, as well as by exploration of semantics and syntactics of codes and practicing programming.</p>

<p>This repository is for now used to store and exchange examples and tryouts between our group. Feel free to crawl through the jungle, maybe we'll add the essays on media-theory as well and complete the repo with some nice pages. </p>

<p>If you're familiar with GitHub, you could checkout the repo and play with the examples. Make a pull-request or get in touch if you want to contribute.</p>

<p>Ever since we have been trying to understand nature. Through observation, abstraction and formalization we are able to describe our environment. Thereby it’s even possible to computate it. But is it that simple, as abstraction always means a reduction of the whole? Furthermore nature is also based on non-linear and dynamic processes which are hardly predictable by the use of conventional algorithms. Thereby alternative computational models are required.</p>

<p>We will have a look on a mechanistic world view, the history of cybernetics and current research topics such as neural networks and genetic algorithms. Therefore we invite interestings guests, discuss texts and make small experiments.</p>
